  - Show optional timer if game format supports it
- Extend FEN parser

# Bugs

- Fix going backwards/forwards in moves played
- Get looping straight; no repeated computations for move generation i.e.
- Try moving right rook, then later move the queen before trying to castle long; some weird thing happens here where king temporarily has access to queen moves
